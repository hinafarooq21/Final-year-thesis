# Final-year-thesis: Weather induced bridge closures in the UK and measuring the efficiency of the UK strategic road network.

## Overview

With the increasing occurrence of false bridge closure decisions in the UK, it has become essential to review the systems in place across the country that determine whether a bridge is safe for public use during severe wind conditions. This research aims to evaluate the reliability and effectiveness of the systems employed by local authorities, including Severe Weather Information Systems (SWIS), the Met Office, and other relevant decision-making processes.

## Purpose

Severe wind conditions are becoming more prevalent across the UK, with variations depending on region. This makes it increasingly important to assess the accuracy of the systems used to make decisions regarding bridge closures during such events. This study focuses on the accuracy and effectiveness of local authorities' decision-making systems in ensuring public safety during severe wind events.

## Scope

The research aims to:

- Investigate the effectiveness of Severe Weather Information Systems (SWIS), the Met Office, and local authority decision-making processes in accurately assessing bridge safety during severe wind conditions.
- Examine the impact of false bridge closure decisions, including public dissatisfaction and financial losses.
- Assess the reliability of information sources used by local authorities to ensure they are making well-informed decisions that safeguard the public.

## Objectives

This study seeks to:

1. Evaluate the weather forecasting systems especially SWIS and identify any sources of errors that could lead to incorrect information being sent out.
2. Retrieve data for bridge closures and evaluate whether the system was correct or not.
3. Review the Bridge Closure Protocols of the selected bridges and suggest improvements that should be made in order to make the roads safer.
4. Compare the bridge closure protocols used in the UK to other countries and evaluate their efficiencies.

## Limitations of the Study

This study has several limitations that should be considered when interpreting the findings:

1. **Limited Information on SWIS**: There is a lack of detailed research on the Severe Weather Information System (SWIS), as it is a relatively new network, resulting in brief and repetitive available data.

2. **Small Sample Size**: The analysis was based on a very small sample size of just two specimens, due to limited time.

3. **Data Quality**: The data, sourced from Twitter, local news, and Highways England, was self-collected without external validation. While satisfactory, its accuracy and reliability could be improved, and it was affected by network errors.

4. **Time and Resource Constraints**: Limited time and resources impacted the depth of research, as the study was conducted alongside other academic commitments.

5. **Reliance on Secondary Sources**: The study relied solely on secondary data from journals, newspapers, and online sources, without primary research.

6. **Potential Bias**: Information from official sources like the Met Office and Highways England may introduce bias, affecting the objectivity of the findings.
